It basically involved creating a dictionary
  Splitting text file into words
  Counting the frequency of the words that matched the certain criteria like
  removing Boring-Small words and Ignoring Punctuations if any.
 
 and then word cloud module does the rest :)
 Plots an awesome word cloud from the dictionary that we passed to it having keys as Words and values as frequency!
